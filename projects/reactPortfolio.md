For my portfolio website project in February 2024, I created a comprehensive platform to highlight my professional background, skills, and achievements. I structured and styled the site using Â technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Using React, I developed reusable components that made the website easier to maintain and scale. I used Bootstrap to create a clean, modern, and responsive design that looks great on all devices and screen sizes. I also used GitHub for version control to keep the project organized, and I hosted the website on Netlify for easy access. This project demonstrates my ability to create professional web applications with modern development practices.
